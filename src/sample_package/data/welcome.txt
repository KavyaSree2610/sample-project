Welcome to Sample Package!

This is a sample text file included with the package.
It demonstrates how to include data files in your Python package.

You can read this file using:

import pkg_resources
content = pkg_resources.resource_string('sample_package', 'data/welcome.txt').decode('utf-8')

Or using the newer importlib.resources:

from importlib import resources
content = resources.read_text('sample_package.data', 'welcome.txt')

This file can contain any text data that your package might need.
